https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/

CREATE TABLE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, DECIMAL(8,2), ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE, AUTO INCREMENT

INSERT INTO VALUES

SELECT, AS

ORDER BY ASC, DESC

SELECT DISTINCT => to remove duplicate rows from a result set

NULL values

SQL LIMIT OFFSET => To limit the number of rows returned, OFFSET is optional, LIMIT determines the number of rows, OFFSET skips the offset rows before beginning to return the rows

SQL LIMIT clause is not supported by SQL server, it uses OFFSET FETCH

SQL WHERE CLAUSE

YEAR FUNCTION

BETWEEN CLAUSE

SQL LOGICAL OPERATORS => all, and, any, between, exists, in, like, not, or, some

SQL ALIAS

SQL INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, SELF JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN DOES NOT WORK IN MYSQL SERVER USE UNION(RIGHT JOIN = LEFT JOIN)

SQL GROUP BY, GROUP BY WITH INNER JOIN, GROUP BY with HAVING clause

GROUP BY ROLLUP

SQL SUBQUERY, SQL correlated SUBQUERY

SQL UNION OPERATOR

SQL intersect operator

SQL CASE

SQL SERVER MINUS / MYSQL SERVER DOES NOT SUPPORT IT. Use NOT IN or LEFT JOIN

SQL UPDATE, INSERT INTO, DELETE

SQL AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM

SQL DATA TYPES

SQL DELETE, SQL TRUNCATE

SQL PRIMARY KEY => A table consists of columns and rows. Typically, a table has a column or set of columns whose values uniquely identfy each row in the table.
This column or the set of columns is called the primary key.
Each table has one and only one primary key. The primary key does not accept NULL or duplicate values

SQL FOREIGN KEY => A foreign key is a column or a group of columns that enforces a link between the data in two tables. 

SQL UNIQUE constraint => Sometimes, we want to make sure that the values in a column or a set of columns are not duplicate.
For example, duplicate emails in the employees table are not acceptable. But the email column is not the part of the primary key, 
the only way to prevent duplicate values in the email column is to use a UNIQUE constraint.

UNIQUE vs. PRIMARY KEY constraints => You can have at most one PRIMARY KEY constraint whereas you can have multiple UNIQUE constraints
